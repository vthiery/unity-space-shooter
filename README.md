# Unity - Space Shooter #
This repository contains the assets and project settings needed for the Unity's tutorials on the [Space shooter](https://unity3d.com/fr/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial) and on [creating a main menu](https://unity3d.com/fr/learn/tutorials/topics/user-interface-ui/creating-main-menu).

## Why this repository? ##
I created this repository mainly to store what I did during the tutorials and what I have experimented.

## How do I start? ##
Just open Unity (at lease version 5.4 of the engine) and load the assets and project settings. The game should be ready to build and should work as expected.
A lot of sub-menus are actually empty and shall be completed. Nevertheless, the main menu's functionalities are working, as well as the game.
